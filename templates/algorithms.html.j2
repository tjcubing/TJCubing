{% block intro %} An algorithm is a set of moves that move pieces around the Rubik's cube. It is important that you learn fast algorithms from the beginning because they are crucial to your times and are fairly difficult to change. Here are some of the suggested links and PDF's for common algorithm sets. {% endblock %}
