# TJ Cubing Website

Currently the official [website for Rubik's Cube Club](https://activities.tjhsst.edu/cubing/) at [Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology](https://tjhsst.fcps.edu/).

## Setup
This project uses [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) as a Python backend.  
Install [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv) and then run `pipenv install` to install all of the Python depdendancies.

Styling is done through [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). Compile the custom sass (.SCSS) file into CSS via `sass static/scss/custom.scss static/css/custom.css`.

Website primarily made through [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).

[TJ Oauth](https://ion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing/oauth.html) is used for the voting system.

## File Structure

- /app.py: Main file which actually serves the website. Don't use:

    ```python
    if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run()
    ```
      
    as there are [glitches with the automatic file reloading](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/server/#in-code).
    Instead use: 
    
    ```bash
    export FLASK_APP=app.py
    export FLASK_ENV=development
    pipenv run flask run
    ```
