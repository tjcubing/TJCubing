# TJCubing Website

Currently the official [website for Rubik's Cube Club](https://activities.tjhsst.edu/cubing/) 
at [Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology](https://tjhsst.fcps.edu/) (TJHSST).

## Setup
This project uses [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) as a Python backend.
Install [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv)
and then run `pipenv install` to install all of the Python dependencies.

Styling is done through [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). Compile
the custom sass (.SCSS) file into CSS via `gulp watch`.

Website primarily made through [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).

[Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) is used in a hacky way to copy files from
`node_modules` to `static/` as well as do some other miscellaneous
tasks, including concatenating and minimizing JavaScript, and images.
Run `gulp build` to build the website.

[TJ Oauth](https://ion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing/oauth.html)
is used for the voting system.

[WCA Oauth](https://github.com/thewca/worldcubeassociation.org/wiki/OAuth-documentation-notes)
is used for verifying TJ records.

## Running

Don't use:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
  app.run()
```

as there are [glitches with the automatic file reloading](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/server/#in-code).
Instead use: 

```bash
pipenv run flask run 
```

or, make it available to other devices on the same network:
```bash
pipenv run flask run --host='0.0.0.0'
```

or, to use HTTPS (this is necessary for testing [Fido U2F](https://www.yubico.com/authentication-standards/fido-u2f/)):
```bash
pipenv run flask run --cert=adhoc
```

When testing U2F and the Oauth APIs, be sure to go to
https://localhost:5000/ instead of https://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Using HTTPS will make Chrome say "Your connection is not private".
Recently, Google removed the ability to click "Advanced" -> proceed anyways. 
To get around this, type "thisisunsafe" and hit enter.

To debug on mobile, follow the instructions
[here](https://appletoolbox.com/use-web-inspector-debug-mobile-safari/). If
the phone doesn't appear in the develop menu, install the Safari technology
preview with `brew cask install safari-technology-preview` and follow
the tips given [here](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/123530).
This enables a console and inspect element.

## Future Plans
- Switch from JSON to SQLAlchemy database
- Add optional breadcrumbs
- Python tests
- New pages
  - Hardware page (links to Cubicle, SCS, my hardware table)
  - Hardware, Boron treatment, magnetization (in misc/guides)
  - Make nav bar recursive
- Admin Page
  - Ability to edit files through a file editor 
  - Refresh buttons
    - meetings in history
    - sitemap
    - rendered templates for search
      - suffix trees for search feature
  - Simulate jumps forward in time
  - Request increase in power, requests go to logfile, logfile parsed and delivered as notifications page to admin
- Passwordless login
- Ability to delete emails from the archive
- Unsubscribing from the email list
- Congratulate when a new TJ record is set
- Calculate sum of ranks (SOR) and Kinch score relative to TJ rankings
- Ability to click on an event and see the TJ ranking, similar to the WCA site
- Hall of Fame (each person with name + year + WCA profile + picture)
- Stronger profiles
  - Click on a name and it shows their history in all the weekly comps, graph of ao5 over time, TJ records held, etc.
- GPG sign emails
- A [Warrant canary](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/warrant-canary-faq) 
in the vein of [rsync](https://www.rsync.net/resources/notices/canary.txt)
