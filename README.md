# TJ Cubing Website

Currently the official [website for Rubik's Cube Club](https://activities.tjhsst.edu/cubing/) at [Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology](https://tjhsst.fcps.edu/).

## Setup
This project uses [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) as a Python backend.  
Install [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv) and then run `pipenv install` to install all of the Python dependencies.

Styling is done through [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). Compile the custom sass (.SCSS) file into CSS via `gulp watch`.

Website primarily made through [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).

[Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) is used in a hacky way to copy files from `node_modules` to `static/` as well as do some other miscellaneous tasks, including concatenating and minimizing JavaScript, and images. Run `gulp build` to build the website. 

[TJ Oauth](https://ion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing/oauth.html) is used for the voting system.

[WCA Oauth](https://github.com/thewca/worldcubeassociation.org/wiki/OAuth-documentation-notes) is used for verifying TJ records.

## File Structure

- /app.py: Main file which actually serves the website. Don't use:

    ```python
    if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run()
    ```

    as there are [glitches with the automatic file reloading](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/server/#in-code).
    Instead use: 
    
    ```bash
    pipenv run flask run 
    ```

    or, make it available to other devices on the same network:
    ```bash
    pipenv run flask run --host='0.0.0.0'
    ```

    or, to use https (this is necessary for testing [Fido U2F](https://www.yubico.com/authentication-standards/fido-u2f/)):
    ```bash
    pipenv run flask run --cert=adhoc
    ```
    Also, be sure to go to https://localhost:5000/ instead of https://127.0.0.1:5000/.

    Using https will make Chrome say "Your connection is not private".
    Recently, Google removed the ability to click "Advanced" -> proceed anyways. 
    To get around this, type "thisisunsafe" and hit enter.

    You might be tempted to background the process. 
    On my computer, this makes the website run _incredibly_ slowly.
    Instead, open a terminal window and just let it vibe there.

## Future Plans
- Recreate Twisttheweb (used to be an online timer for racing your friends, now is a mosaic site)
- Switch from JSON to SQLAlchemy database
- Add optional breadcrumbs
- Python tests
- New pages
  - Hardware page (links to Cubicle, SCS, my hardware table)
  - Hardware, Boron treatment, magnetization (in misc/guides)
  - Make nav bar recursive
- Admin Page
  - Ability to edit files through a file editor 
  - Refresh buttons
    - meetings in history
    - sitemap
    - rendered templates for search
      - suffix trees for search feature
  - Simulate jumps forward in time
  - Request increase in power, requests go to logfile, logfile parsed and delivered as notifications page to admin
- Ability to delete emails from the archive
- Congratulate when a new TJ record is set
- Calculate sum of ranks (SOR) and Kinch score relative to TJ rankings
- Ability to click on an event and see the TJ ranking, similar to the WCA site
- Hall of Fame (each person with name + year + WCA profile + picture)
- Stronger profiles
  - Click on a name and it shows their history in all the weekly comps, graph of ao5 over time, TJ records held, etc.
- GPG sign emails
